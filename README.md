"Free-Form Grid Structure Multi-Objective Optimization Associated with Integrated Design and Machine Learning"

Note: This project is currently under development for publication.

Research Highlights:
•	Investigating the challenge of constructing efficient free-form grid structures.
•	Leveraging the Iranian Chahar-Lengeh Girih pattern for structural design.
•	Using the Hankin Method to control grid structure parameters (P).
•	Employing a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (NSGAII) for optimization.
•	Reducing Mass, Displacement, and Elastic Energy as primary objectives.
•	Utilizing K-Means Clustering to explore diverse solutions.
•	Achieving significant improvements in Displacement and Elastic Energy.

Code Repository:
•	NSGAII Python code for multi-objective optimization.
•	Grasshopper definitions for the integrated design workflow.
•	Girih Geometry Python codes for generating modules on the free-form structure.

It is important to note that this project is an integral part of a more extensive research trajectory known as "Functional Paradigms" conducted by the Ardaena.com team. Our work showcases the synergistic integration of architectural design, structural engineering, and machine learning, signifying a promising step forward in the realm of free-form grid structures. For those interested in further exploration and implementation, we are delighted to share our open-source code repository, which includes NSGAII Python code, Grasshopper definitions for the workflow, and Girih Geometry Python codes for generating modules on the free-form structure.
